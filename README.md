Robot Lab from Asset Store adopted for Unity 2018.3</br>
https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/essentials/tutorial-projects/robot-lab-unity-4x-7006

It was upgraded with Unity autoupgrade API and navmeshes was rebaked manually.

Maybe upgrade was not very accurate but at the first sight it looks OK.
